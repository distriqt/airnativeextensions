We've developed a number of Adobe AIR Native Extensions for use with iOS and Android mobile platforms.

These extensions enhance the power of Adobe AIR on mobile devices, giving developers access to low-level device OS features which are not available through the standard AIR framework.

For a guide on how to get started using these extensions, see our blog post [here](http://distriqt.com/post/815).

Generally our extensions are supported for iOS v5+ and Android SDK v10+, however this will vary with each extension so make sure to read the documentation for any specific requirements.

For more about the extensions and how to use them [see our website](http://distriqt.com/native-extensions)
