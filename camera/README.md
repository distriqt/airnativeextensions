# Camera

The camera extension gives you access to advanced features of the camera not available through the Flash framework. This includes access to the flash modes, exposure and white balance control, and focus point.

Additionally this extension allows you to take a photo using the camera while simultaneously saving it to the camera roll and accessing it in your Flash application as BitmapData.

Please note this is not a replacement for CameraUI but gives you the ability to build your own.
